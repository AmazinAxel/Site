Website announcement | 11/17/2021 | Announcement |

I announced earlier that I was transferring my website over to a dedicated server, and I just wanted to announce that it was unsuccessful. I had a lot of issues with the migration, and pointing the domain didnt work. This means that my website will stay on the same server and you guys shouldnt notice anything from before. Even though the migration didnt work, I still have a couple more updates. My front page posts will also have a timestamp, and my backend got a big overhaul. The performance and security is also improved, and my website also got a nice redesign. 

~~

More website updates coming! | (no date) | Website |

now that phase 3 is completed, I am going to start working on some other things that you will see! phase 3 and 2 focused on the backend, now I will focus on the frontend. Be on the lookout for new changes! btw my website will be down for an hour on september 6th because of some maintenance to the server happening 

~~

phase 3 completed! | (no date) | Website |

You may have noticed that my website looks different again, and that is because phase 3 of revamping my website is done! Things load quicker, my website is safer and everything is much better! I have made multiple front end changes along with backend changes, but you guys shouldnt notice many. I am happy with this design, so maybe I will stick with it for a while. I just want you guys to note that I am using a custom CMS, i have decided to move away from the more popular CMSs like wordpress and bludit, just because its more secure (for you guys and for me) and it has literally EVERYTHING I want and need. There are a couple things that need to be fixed but that is over time. I dont want this to be long, and I just want to say to be on the lookout for new updates and changes! 

~~

new video!! | (no date) | Video |

I made a new video on youtube, showing of my game on roblox! it took me a longtime but its done and i will be putting it on the game page. check out the [youtube video here](https://www.youtube.comwatch?v=9nBonSgjDs0)! 

~~

phase 2 of the revamp | (no date) | Website |

welcome to phase 2 of the revamp! there is now a CMS attached so everything can stay static forever! its open source and not in english so im definitely going to translate it and put it on github. there is a downside to this cms because i have to put HTML tags in things and that takes up useless bandwidth, but there is no workaround. it is worth it though since it doesnt add that much and everything still remains static (and the CSS is cached) everything is running smoothly and perfectly, and stay tuned for phase 3 of the revamp!

~~

renewed website | (no date) | Website |

I completely renewed my website! Everything is completely different from before! if you have noticed recently my site has been down for a couple weeks, since I was prepping everything! There are a couple of new things, like the completely redisigned UI, the new structure, and basically everything. the only thing that didnt change was SWR! I plan on keeping SWR going for every single week as longas I can, and all content from SWR has been imported. All previous posts except for the 4 most recent have been deleted, instead I am going to put what I posted in an SWR, but you can also view the previous content on the web archive

I am so sorry that i didnt post in a couple of weeks, but I have made it up with all of the new posts. I hope you guys like my renewed website!

the weirdest school year | 6/14/2021 | Random |

this school year (2020 - 2021) has been the weirdest school year (and year) for me by far! My school is ending this week so i thought i can share a wrap up of my weirdest school year ever!
\
it all started in august, where we had to do online school instead of in-person school (i love online more than in person) on zoom, which was fine for a little but was a little crazy in the beginning. A couple weeks later sometime in september, the first major school event happened! last years fires were very bad, and destroyed a lot of land. We got really unlucky and got caught up in all the fires and flames and had to evacuate (our area was at a level 2-3 evacuation level) we had to evacuate and go to many different hotels / rental houses, all the while school was "asynchronous" and cancelled. I took this picture when we were evacuating the area to show how bad the smoke was (the sun was red btw)
\
\
![A smokey sky with a red sun.](https://amazinaxel.com/media/Smoke.jpeg)
\
that isnt the only thing that made this school year hard. online classes and fires mixed with an ongoing worldwide pandemic was not the last thing since in feburary we got the opposite of fire, ice! in feburary, a huge storm came over and put snow on the ground, but it also made ice! this came out of nowhere and put the power out for us for about a week and even longer in different areas! they had to cancel school for about a week and our school was pushed back about a week too. We are at our final week of school and it is safe to say that this school year has been the weirdest school year ever for me. thanks for reading everyone!

thoughts on the Caves and Cliffs update part 1 trailer | 6/8/2021 | Thoughts |

I just watched the trailer for the caves and cliffs update and I couldnt stop thinking how much fun those goats are gonna be! the trailer is obviously very funny but im hyped to try it out!

~~
same frontend, entirely different backend! | 6/6/2021 | Website |

You guys may not see a difference but I made it look exactly the same (or tried to) as before the switch but the backend is completely different! before Iwas using wordpress, and I learned wordpress is overkill for what I am trying to accomplish, so now I am using bludit! bludit is an open source CMS like wordpress but it is flat-file and doesnt have all the bloat like wordpress! Everything will stay the same but you may notice a couple changes. if you are like me and you notice your server resources being hogged up by wordpress I recommend using bludit instead

~~

Something cool I found | 6/6/2021 | Random |

As you guys may know the virus is kind of dying down now and school is starting to end so I decided to look through my old school projects from last year, and I actually found one thing I made (for my ELA class) predicting what it would be like in 2021. The following paragraph is my assignment that I want to share with you guys.
\
### Quarantine
\
It was 2021, when everything seemed to get better, it got worse. WAY worse. Everyone started blaming other countries, and that has caused a huge war. Now, the only thing to do is just stay inside. Even all of the people working for important jobs couldn't go to work. The virus has mutated so much, that the chance of survival is only 5%. Over 1 million people have died, and over 2 million people have gotten it. It has gotten so bad, that it seems like the world has ended. You can‚Äôt even go outside, because the virus is all around is in the air. You can't go out to get food (all the shops are closed) and you definitely can't go to the hospital (there are so many people in there, that the medical workers have just given up all hope) The US has wasted so much money giving it to people, that they have become poor. The US is in way worse shape than it was in the Great Depression. This virus has made the stock market go to absolutely nothing, and almost all of the businesses have gone bankrupt. We were stuck at home with little food, little water, and a shortage of toilet paper. Our neighbors have been yelling at us to not waste electricity with the radio, but we really need it, because everyone has been very depressed. Unfortunately, there were a lot of great people that have passed away from the virus, but not everyone has given up hope. There are people in hazmat suits giving away food and water, and all of the homeless people have found refuge in abandoned shops. People have gone absolutely crazy in quarantine, starting riots, fires, and wreaking havoc.
\
Thats the paragraph and I was kind of surprised how accurate it was (I made it in may 2020 when we were getting used to online school) it isnt very good but it was cool to come back to it and check it out

Welcome to my new website! | 6/3/2021 | Website |

As you guys may have noticed, I changed my website theme again üòÆ I have a new glassmorphic design that looks really nice, I got inspired to do it by looking at [Andi‚Äôs Glassmorphic theme](https://blog.andisetiawan.com/2020/glasstime-glassmorphism-wordpress-theme). I downloaded a lightweight theme from wordpress.org to use it as my base theme, and then changed the CSS and some of the html too to make it into a glassmorphic theme! Then I found a website background generator using SVGs so I used it and changed it a little to use it as my background! I fixed some glitches and now I hope you guys like it!

my thoughts on WWDC21 | 6/1/2021 | Thoughts |

I know that wwdc is happening on monday next week but they just released the thumbnail for it and it looks awesome! but, I have a prediction I want to make for it. just by looking at the thumbnail, its all about imessage, there are memojis everywhere, emojis and reactions on it and the laser beam text message affect which leads me to belive that this developers conference will have a lot of things to do with imessage! Im really excited since honestly I use imessage a lot and if they turn it into a ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù platform like some rumors are saying then I would be totally hyped for ios / ipados 15! anyways, happy june 1st everyone! 

~~

Backend changes | 5/27/2021 | Website |

I changed the code of the backend so its faster and better but it also glitched the frontend for some weird reason, if it looks messed up please wipe your cache and force reload the page (on chrome & edge it is `ctrl + shift + r`) After you do that then it should look normal again

RSS Feed Shortcut! | 5/3/2021 | Shortcut |

Welcome to my new website! i am transitioning from blogger to this new one, and it is easier to access! you no longer have to type ‚Äúamazinaxel.blogger.com‚Äù but now ‚Äúamazinaxel.com‚Äù Ialso redesigned the entire site and think it looks a lot better! New projects for the micro:bit coming veryvery soon!

New ROBLOX game! | 5/3/2021 | Roblox |

ISo I got inspired by this post to make an [RSS feed](https://thenextwebcom/news/how-to-create-a-simple-rss-feed-reader-on-ios) shortcut! It seems like such a simple idea, and it was extremely simple to make, but useful! I got the idea to incorporate this into my control panel dashboard later, but for now here is the test version! I noticed that the person who made this article did not give a link to download it and customize it, so I made it myself for everyone to download and use freely! There are a couple simple questions for you to customize it how you like and a simple page to scroll through all the posts. note: I made this and tested it on an iPad 7 on iPadOS 14.5 and it was tested on a device that is on iOS14.5 as well.

Repurposing my old laptop! | 4/3/2021 | Random |

I have an old laptop that is very underpowered and isn‚Äôt that great, and I never use it. I decided that its just a waste for it just sitting in my bedroom doing nothing, so I tried to think of a creative way to do something with it. I realized that I need another monitor for my work, like the new upcoming ROBLOX game I am working on, and then it hit me, I will use this old laptop as a monitor! I went straight into it, looking it up and seeing videos of people doing it. I tried what they did, and it worked! This is what I did: I made sure that the laptop supported Miracast wirelessly, so I could use it wirelessly, and it did luckily, and since it runs Windows 10, I went into the ‚Äúoptional features‚Äù list and clicked ‚ÄúWireless Display‚Äù and it downloaded. After that, I searched ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù in the Cortana bar and connected the computer with the laptop! And, after some adjusting, it worked!! I am really happy with how it works now, but unfortunately since it is an old and slow machine, the framerate is not that good but it is good for displaying static content like code from stack overflow or a messaging service, but I will mainly use it for my SMS client, a static webpage, and most importantly, my email client! If you want to try this yourself, I recommend getting started at this link and learning more here: [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/screen-mirroring-and-projecting-to-your-pc-5af9f371-c704-1c7f-8f0d-fa607551d09c)

Fighting a drone on Dust video! | 4/30/2021 | Video |

We fought a drone on dust! It was part of the new update that got released today, Pre-Alpha 0.18! We found the drone in the desert-y part of the mainland and fought it! it was glitched though, but we were curious what would happen! Eventually, we destroyed it and recycled the rocket and got some good stuff! Link: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW5bdCI1BR0)

New video on Dust | 4/18/2021 | Roblox |

I made my first tutorial video on how to use a sniper in dust. You can turn any short-range sniper in Dust into a sniper if you have the right materials (a scope and slug ammo) You should only use this if you don‚Äôt have an anti-material rifle, anti-material rifle or any type of sniper since it is not as good as a sniper and does not work well late game (though is very effective early-game) Link: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Sc6E461bj40)

New website theme! | 4/16/2021 | Website |

As you can probably see (unless you are reading this from a customized RSS reader which this website supports) I changed the theme to be a lot different from all of the other sites. I decided to change my site theme because I want my site to stand out from the others, and I think this theme does a great job. I will continue to use this theme for a little, but for now I am still polishing it. More updates and stuff is coming soon! (a python micro:bit project is in the works)

My first Shortcut | 4/13/2021 | Shortcut |

I had no internet for a couple of days and I wanted to program or script something, but since I had no internet there was no way to program stuff, but, i did bring my phone and ipad, and I had this app called ‚ÄúShortcuts‚Äù installed on it so I decided to make a project on it (I know its not real coding, its drag and drop block coding stuff but its better than nothing) I decided to make a control panel app that makes it so you can open a control-panel thing that is very customizable, that allows you to change settings quickly all from one menu (kind of like the control center but with more options on iOS 14.4.2 and iPadOS 14.4.2) If you want to check it out then click the link below!

New scratch project! | 3/24/2021 | micro:bit |

Recently I got a new micro:bit, so I wanted to start learning some python. Since I only know block coding well, I decided to do my first hybrid project where I combined block coding and python. I made a simple game and it was kinda fun to play. There are a lot of things that you can do with this, you can remix it and add sound effects, make the game progressively get harder, and more! \

Roombot project final update? | 3/13/2021 | Roombot |

So in my previous post I said that there may be a final update just to fix things up and it may be the last. Now, I was using my codey with the Roombot version that I created and saw how so slow it is! So this is the final version that adds Wifi Broadcasting capabilities, which means you can use a program on your phone to talk to Codey or rocky, and make it do things like show a message or toggle the LED light on the codey! Also to make things easier, I removed the home screen so now it is just a blank screen, which makes it easier since you can leave it on 24/7 and not worry about the battery draining as fast! Right when it boots up it connects to wifi, gathers information in your area and displays it on the screen when it first boots up! And you can now go at your own pace by switching to go forward by pressing button "B"! You can also now gather a second round of information by staying in that menu and pressing "C"! As you can see this is a very big update, and I hope everyone likes it! Feel free to make some remixes and add some of your own features!\

Roombot project future | 2/27/2021 | Roombot |

Recently, I have finished posting my Roombot project, and I would just like to say that this project (in the future) may not be supported with new features and things (there is a chance I might come back to it and add new features / fix bugs and things like that) But for now, I am at a loss for things to add and I have a feeling this project may get boring later on, so I just want to say that **this project may / will get cancelled in the future** without any warning or anything. But, it will stay online and the project and the links will all stay the same, and everyone is free to look at the source code below with the Python code link.  You can make any remixes or edits as you want, but the main part of the program may not be updated at all starting today (there still might be random updates in the future though) and remember everyone, keep on coding! \

Roombot project finally finished!! | 2/26/2021 | Roombot |

A while ago, I was talking about working on the Roombot. It was a cool idea, so I went ahead and started working on it in my free time. I ended up finally finished it, so I decided to give you all the link to use on your codey! More information is available on themBlock website page on this link! Enjoy everyone! :) https:/planet.mblock.cc/project/623491

Roombot possibly coming soon? | 2/19/2021 | Roombot |

2 days ago I was talking about thinking of starting a new Roombot project on mBlock for codey, and so far I have started work on it! It is not even close enough for testing or even release anytime soon, but I hope that it will be very polished and work! If you have an extra codey lying around this could be a good use for it! I expect it to have the first early beta release sometime soon but remember, that this project may be cancelled any time, but if it does I will put the source code if Ido cancel the project

~~

Roombot possibly coming soon? | 2/17/2021 | Roombot | 

I am working on a new project, called Roombot, which isjust source code that can control a room using infrared sensors on the Codey. There will be basic features and a minigame to play, so far its in an extremely early stage, and this may become an unfinished project in the near future. Stay tuned on this website to learn more when I get further into it.
