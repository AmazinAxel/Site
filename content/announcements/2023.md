New project release! | 6/17/2023 | New |
I've just released a new project called [GitCMS](https://gitcms.amazinaxel.com)! It's a great way to manage your sites by giving you an amazing Markdown editor ([SimpleMDE](https://simplemde.com)) and an intuitive UI. It's now open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/AmazinAxel/GitCMS), and [the website is now live](https://gitcms.amazinaxel.com). I've created my own authentication script to work with Cloudflare Functions (Workers) and it works great. In fact, I'm writing this post right now using GitCMS! It has an over-animated UI, so its great for people who love eye-candy. It's also very fast and light on bandwidth, and doesn't use any back-end dependencies. It's also fully static (except for the authentication script) so it doesn't rely on NPM or any packages. It uses the GitHub API & an OAuth app to connect to your GitHub account and features a lightweight code editor (Codeflask) / viewer and defaults to a nice text editor on unsupported files. It also allows you to view media, such as videos, images, and audio, without ever leaving the comfort of the file browser! This project is licensed under GPL v3, so you can use it for pretty much any purpose.

Here's what GitCMS looks like in its first release:

Major new website updates | 6/10/2023 | Website |
Over the next few weeks, you will see a lot of changes. First off, I've made my migration away from Hostinger and all is going very well. Secondly, I  have started a migration of data from AmazinAxel.com to AlecsHome.com. I will no longer include SWR posts or announcements from AmazinAxel.com on AlecsHome.com, and they will only be available here on AlecsHome. AmazinAxel will become a landing site with a nice design and all blog content there will be removed. I have also made [my website open source on GitHub](https://github.com/AmazinAxel/Site), for anyone to inspect! The landing site will become open source on GitHub as well, however it is still private as it's still in development. I also expect some development slowdowns on my project because we will be taking a trip this next weekend & will be taking a trip to Seattle during Independence Day. The Lofi player site has also changed to [lofi.amazinaxel.com](https://lofi.amazinaxel.com) from amazinaxel.com/lofi. I am revamping my entire online presense, my content style will change to a more professional format, my GitHub profile will become more important, and I'm adopting a new design style. It's going to take a while to completely finish this migration, but it'll be great once it's finished. I'll make sure to keep you all up-to-date here on the continuing updates!

New website, new backend, new everything! | 6/2/2023 | Website |

Well, as I promised from [this weeks' SWR post](https://amazinaxel.com/swr/2023), I've made a new website! Yes, what you're seeing here is my new website, and it looks great! Everything is nice, modern, clean, and faster than ever. I've started my transition away from unsustainable platforms, and I'm making my way into the future! Cloudflare Pages now hosts this site for completely free (unlike before, Hostinger was more restrictive and costed us a lot of money) and provides unlimited bandwidth & usage. This is all thanks to my website becoming 100% static (except for the Workers part, which I'll get to in a bit) because of my own, custom-built static site generator! That's right, I made my own static site generator just for this site, and it works great. I found that other blogging platforms were too bloated, and I felt like learning a new language, so I spent the last 2 weeks building this site. 

### How did I create it?

I used Node.js for the backend build tool, Marked for rendering Markdown into HTML, Nunjucks as the templating engine (subject to change), Day.js for the time / date formatting, and Cloudflare Pages for hosting this site! I setup Wrangler to help develop the site, and learned about how to use NPM and the Cloudflare ecosystem. I really like the ecosystem, everything works great and things are super fast! I also had to figure out a way to get the contact form working, so I used Pages Functions (which are just Workers made for Pages) and integrated it with Workers KV (my preferred storage platform) to create the contact form, whilst keeping the entire site affordable to maintain (now I'm just paying for the 2 domains, not the hosting!) and easy to update. Just a quick note, I may consider making this open source, but for now, I'm keeping it closed source for security purposes.

Lofi Player's First Stable Release! | 5/17/2023 | Lofi Player |

Today, Lofi Player has permanently exited public beta and has entered into a stable version! Throughout the past 2 weeks, I have been hard at work making many, many development sprints and iterations on this program, and it's safe to release it into a stable version. I feel very accomplished and I'm ready to move on, so you won't notice many more updates to it. There are just too many new features that have been added in the past couple weeks, so you'll need to go see the Changelog, located in the navigation panel. I still plan on adding more tracks to the radios, so it's important that you still keep clicking that 'Update' button whenever new tracks are added. It would mean a lot to me if you shared this application with your friends to help it grow, and I really hope that you all enjoy this gift to the world!

Important: New Project Announcement & Beta Release! | 5/8/2023 | Lofi Player |

Hi everyone! Today, I want to announce a project that I've been spending my last week working on. It's called Lofi Player (and yes, I do plan on changing that name) and it's a free, Spotify & YouTube alternative to listen to free music that you can use in your livestream or videos! You can use it to relax, chill, focus, study, code, or even use it to sleep! Lo-fi is very popular now, and I really like lo-fi music, so why not make an easy way for people to access completely free (as in less-restrictive licensing) lo-fi music? I worked heavily on the UI to make it as clean of an experience for users, and added a system for switching between various radios! Everything is as clean as you would expect, with changing backgrounds, clean animations, and other useful features, but instead of paying for a service like YouTube and Spotify with ads, you can use my Lofi Player (that doesn't have ads) for a better experience! As of now, it has over 120 different public domain (although CC licensed-songs may be added in the future) songs, and more are being added! This project has now been released into a public beta, after a short time in private pre-release-beta! Stay up-to-date on the changelog for the Lofi Player by checking out either this blog or the Changelog feature in the Lofi Player itself to learn about new features! Share this application with your friends so we can grow and become better! Thank you.

New Language Chart Addition | 4/23/2023 | Update |

This morning, I worked on a new feature to add to my [About](/about-me) page. It's a language chart that shows my proficiency in different languages (and includes HTML and CSS although they aren't real "programming languages") and includes some extra details and explanations as well. The progress bars show the amount of progress that I've made in learning a language. It also includes languages that I already know or languages that I don't use anymore. You can see additional information, such as what the language is and what I know about it, by hovering over the bar! I also have been doing some additional CSS changes to the website, like animating the [TL;DR section](/privacy-policy#TLDR) on my Privacy Policy. Stay tuned for more updates, soon coming to the Projects page!

Every day is Earth Day! | 4/22/2023 | Random |

Today is Earth Day, where many people around the world try to do their part in helping save the Earth. Every day should be Earth Day in order to avoid the disaster we are getting ourselves into. Many people wouldn't know that servers are a large source of pollution because they use a lot of energy and computers are in general not good for the environment. However, because I do not host this website on my Raspberry Pi, I instead use a hosting service known as [Hostinger](https://hostinger.com) to host this website. To keep their prices cheap, I assume that they don't put much effort into helping save the planet. I have searched their [blog](https://www.hostinger.com/blog/) but couldn't find anything about them helping save Earth. Because of this, I was considering switching away from Hostinger when my 1-year contract expires next April. I am considering something more green and Earth-friendly like [Uberspace.de](https://uberspace.de), which is a German hosting provider that also has a bonus of allowing me to use other web languages, like Go, Ruby, Django (and other Python web frameworks), Node, and Perl. They are also environmentally friendly because their homepage advertises that they use green energy to power their servers and are sustainable to both the planet and their employees. I need some recommendations on some other web hosting providers before I make the switch away from Hostinger. What are your thoughts of Uberspace and Hostinger, and what other web hosting providers would you recommend? Let me know through my [contact form on my About page!](/about-me) And remember, every day is Earth day!

More security with Cloudflare Turnstile! | 4/19/2023 | Update |

This site now uses [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/)! I have updated the Privacy Policy to reflect this change, and I no longer require a math captcha for users. This is good news for users who don't know what 2 + 4 is, because now the authentication process should be fully automatic and shouldn't require any user input! This update is now available and live on my Contact form on the [About Me](/about-me) page. I have been working on small but impactful updates to my site recently to make the user experience better, and I am committed to making my website the best experience it could be to all users. This update will make everything more seamless while maintaining your privacy. Please read the Cloudflare Privacy Policy to understand how this change impacts your privacy. Additionally, I fixed many bugs on the website, like the page animations and the glitched Contact form.

New open-source project: DoggoCMS! | 4/18/2023 | New! |

Today I have released a new project that I've been working on for the past 2 days. It's a simple static CMS created in PHP for use on static websites. I originally made it for my [brother's website](https://eaglelistic.com) but I've decided to make it [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/AmazinAxel/DoggoCMS) for everyone to use. It's under the non-restrictive MIT license and you're free to modify and redistribute it. It's main features are it's lightweight-ness, extendibility, and it's ease of use. Simply plop the 2 scripts on your server in a directory and you're set! It was a quick, 2-day project to help my bro out with his website, but I think it'll be useful for many other people out there. I might consider making some updates for it in the future, however I would like to make a disclaimer that this is in doggo lingo, meaning that it's going to be very cringey. It also contains some useless features that you may consider removing, like the random messages that are shown when you create a new blog post. This system also has the ability to upload files to a media directory and copies the code to your clipboard. This CMS is not for everyone, rather it only works on websites with a strict structure that is similar to the structure that this CMS was originally intended for, also known as the [Eaglelistic](https://eaglelistic.com/blog) blogging page. I also created a very in-depth post about this new system on the C1rcuitBr0s website, which will be released once C1rcuitBr0s is fully finished (more to come later!!) Anyways, have fun with this!

More Project page updates! | 4/15/2023 | Update |

Today, I have continued the development of the Project Management System and worked on the front-end, which are the things that you can see! Check out the new [Projects page](/projects) as it is now live! This new page was created entirely from my backend panel, which is pretty much a CMS (content management system) at this point. This also means there is new and updated content (finally) on the page, and new images! NOTE: For caching reasons, you may have to do a force reload (CTRL + SHIFT + R) of the page to clear your cache and get the new images, as I haven't implemented the cache busting for these images. Additionally, I have completely and fully finished the project management system backend and fixed many bugs that would have broken the Projects page. I did some extra styling to the Projects page, so you will feel a much different experience while browsing there. Overall, I am very happy with the result and I'm glad that I'm able to update my projects easily again!

New Project Management System | 4/14/2023 | New! |

Today I have released a new project management system for my website. The projects page on my website now can be fully updated to my current projects instead of being outdated because I don’t feel like updating the HTML. So instead, I spent 10 hours working on a new system that allows me to create new projects, change the visibility of them,  update the subtitle, button, image, and text, and retains the static HTML code for this website. Additionally, the new management system includes a to do list, notetaking, and other useful features that come in handy when trying to manage a project. I will be working on a new feature soon that will allow me to share access to others to collaborate on projects, however that will take me a while. My backend management system has also been updated to work better on mobile devices, and I’m even writing this post from my iPad! I’ve been able to complete this portion of my project because of my reduced school time as I’m nearing the summer and have a smaller workload. Stay updated for more cool new stuff coming to this website!

My new favorite type of lo-fi music! | 4/11/2023 | Random |

Today, the [Lofi Girl YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LofiGirl) has released a new 24/7 livestream, [the synthwave radio.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVPTGNGiI-4&ab_channel=LofiGirl) It's safe to say that this is my new favorite type of lo-fi music, as I was only listening to the [original radio.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk&ab_channel=LofiGirl) The channel had a big reveal up to this moment, and I was excited when I first heard about LofiWorld. If you're into low-fidelity audio like me, I would recommend trying out the new synthwave radio.

New Minecraft game coming soon? | 4/5/2023 | Minecraft |

My friends and I have been working on a new, Minehut-only Minecraft game that's based on a game called [Doors (Roblox)](https://www.roblox.com/games/6516141723). It's a game where you have to go through doors and get past puzzles, entities, and bosses. We are recreating a unique version of this on the popular Minecraft platform, Minehut. The game is called Escaprs and will feature a small, PvP arena, many different randomly-generated rooms, and is multiplayer so you can play with your friends. It's still under constant development, however we are nearing the release so stay tuned here for more information.

New Blogging Management System! | 4/5/2023 | New! |

Today I did heavy development on the site and got so much done! I have developed a new system that allows me to easily create a new blog post, and it will appear on the homepage! Additionally, if you scroll down to the bottom of this webpage, you will see a new button that says "View the Archive". This button allows you to view all of my previous posts from all of my old websites! I have found and put together all the posts I could find into the archives, and now all of my future posts will be saved in there from now on. I also have organized them by year. The homepage also now will also have a max of 3 blog posts. I also have been developing a better media management system, and a better way at keeping track of dates. Sorry for any inconvenience caused today for the abrupt website shutdown - I was busy adding all of these awesome features! Finally, all of this is managed by my control panel, so now it's easier than ever to add posts, media, and archives are now completely automated!

First post of my new blog system! | 4/5/2023 | Update |

This is my first post on the new blog system! I've been working on it heavily this past week because I've had extra time (it's spring break here in Washington!) and it's now a part of my backend system which is growing bigger with more site management features. I'll be making a post soon about this new system!
