The realm is resetting!! | 10/3/2020 | Realm |
i am thinking of making a new SMP season for 1.17 instead of just expanding the map, because 1.17 adds wayyy more things and i dont have to just reset the nether like i would have for 1.16

No Iron Golem changes!! | 10/10/2020 | HardCraft / AmazinCraft |

This is just to inform everyone that there will not be any iron golem changes to the server, but we will just create a rule of no afk farms or any automatic farms. Also, the server restarted a few nights ago to fix the border in the nether and end bug, as well as removing the border and replacing it with barriers (thanks to Hawk_King for helping!) -AmazinAxel

The realm is resetting!! | 10/3/2020 | HardCraft / AmazinCraft |

The realm will be wiping on Sunday, October 4th to add some new crafting recipes. This will now not be in the testing version, which means after these tests there should not be any more wipes. Enjoy everyone! -AmazinAxel
