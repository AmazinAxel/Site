Upcoming Website Revamp | 10/3/2022 | Website |
In the coming weeks / months, I will be transferring to a more "professional" type of site. Before, my site had grammatical issues, spelling mistakes and many other things that would make a normal visitor think that my site was not professional. As the views on my site are changing, I think that it is time to start actually capitalizing stuff and spelling things right. The SWRs from 2021 and 2022 are not going to be spell checked and updated, but instead moved to an old archive. From today forward, I am going to start making my SWRs grammatically correct and spell checked. I will also go through every single page on this website and make everything more professional. This process might take a while just due to the amount of content that I have on my website so I will be working on this slowly throughout the month.

Upcoming website maintenance!!! | 3/7/2022 | Website |
As you might know, amazinaxel.com is now almost 1 year old and I have made the decision to move my domain to a new registrar. Currently, my registrar that hosts my domain amazinaxel.com is about to expire and I want to migrate it to a new registrar that is faster and cheaper than my current one. This will require some maintenance and my website will be down for a couple days starting tomorrow (3/7/2022) to possibly 3/11/2022. This will increase performance, security and make this website even cheaper to host once I do move it.

WizardryKB has a release date!!! | 2/25/2022 | WizardryKB |

Over the past couple of months, I have been steadily getting progress done throughout my game that I have been working on for months. The game is finally getting a release date, and even has a trailer now! There is a discord server also that is getting ready for the release (will post it here) and there is a custom icon that has been made by me as well (it was hand-drawn so it has some minor design issues) which I think is pretty cool. The game is releasing on March 1st, 2022 and will feature wands, custom items, a cool map and PvP combat!! Go check the trailer out at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn1RRgOWNx4 and connect to either one of the IPs once the game has been released!!

Self-hosted version: play.amazinaxel.com

Game Update | 2/25/2022 | Update |

I am going to release a Minecraft server soon, and I have everything planned out from a release date to a trailer, but the only issue so far is to fix some small issues and smooth out the game a little, and then the game will be released! Stay tuned here for updates regarding the game, and get ready to play the game once it has released!

New Game Announcement | 2/17/2022 | Announcement |

I just wanted to give everyone a notice that I am developing a new minigame for Minecraft. It is going to have 2 versions, one is playable on Minehut and the other version is self hosted. The game is expected to have a beta release sometime next week or next month, and I will make a trailer and give the IP for when it releases. Stay tuned here for updates about the game!

More website changes | 1/22/2022 | Website |
You might notice some changes coming to the website later, like that I am reformatting the entire site to use capitals and I might add a couple pages, such as wikis for FreePvP. Also, check out the [beta for a new Scratch game I am developing here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/570890071/) and it might be very glitchy but you can try it now before I make it a website exclusive game!
