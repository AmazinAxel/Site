# Hey!

I'm AmazinAxel, and I create stuff on the internet! I play video games and work on various projects. I'm based in the PNW, near Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, Canada.

I focus more on developing websites and creating things for the web. I am very proficient in PHP and JavaScript, and of course HTML & advanced CSS (see my skill chart below!). I also am very good with Skript (a Minecraft coding language for servers) and handling / managing Linux servers. I also have (less in-depth) experience with video editing and creating Roblox games.

# Skill Chart
<!-- Maybe change this to an accordion? -->
I've been making websites and games for many years, however I'm still learning new things! These progress bars shows an approximate amount of my proficiency in that skill. 100% proficiency would mean that I'm very knowledgeable with that skill and may have some knowledge about some related libraries or frameworks if it's a language, and 0% would mean that I know basically nothing about it.

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'Node.js';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 35%;"> 35% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">I am learning Node.js as an alternative to PHP. I use Node.js on the Cloudflare platform / ecosystem, and I have integrated it with Cloudflare Workers and Cloudflare Pages, and I will be integrating it with Workers KV and other Cloudflare products in the near future. Node.js is becoming increasingly popular due to it's fast JavaScript backend. I also have a good amount of knowledge of the JavaScript Service Worker platform, which is used for client-side processing & backend applications and is heavily utilized on Cloudflare Workers. I also have gotten familiar with many JavaScript libraries used commonly with Node.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'Python';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 30%;"> 30% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">Python is a very simple language that is very heavily used. It is extremely popular and has a large amount of frameworks. It can be used with AI and web development and it is very versatile. I got familiar with Python in 2021 when I started learning about how it worked, and I'm still in the process of learning how to use it. I have used it to program an application for my Raspberry Pi to display useful information on a monitor. I've tried using Django, a Python web development framework. I've made a few useful utilities with it, and I've made a few small applications.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'PHP';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 80%;"> 80% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">This is my main language of choice when it comes to back-end development. PHP is an easy-to-use language that is super simple to set up. I create most of my back-end panels with PHP and I am very experienced with PHP. I have been experimenting with PHP projects since 2021. I have created many large projects with PHP but I don't have much experience with Composer or any other PHP dependency manager.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'HTML'; color: white; "> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 100%;"> 100% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">HTML is a markup language that allows you to create websites. It is a very basic and easy-to-learn language. I already know most things about how HTML works and I have been using it since 2018. I do prefer to use Markdown whenever possible for formatting because of its simplicity.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'Skript'; color: white; "> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 100%;"> 100% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">Skript is a language for coding Minecraft-based things. You can use it to create minigames, custom items, and more without having to use any Java! It is very simple and is written in plain English. I have used it to create many, many games and I'm still using it to create more projects! Skript is a good language for beginners that want to get used to creating Minecraft games without having to dive deep with Java.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'CSS';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 90%;"> 90% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">CSS is a very basic styling engine for webpages. It allows you to style and structure a website however you like. I am very familiar with CSS and have been using it since 2020. I understand most CSS concepts and can create responsive webpages that scale to many screens, such as a small phone screen up to a very large widescreen monitor. I am not familiar with any other CSS frameworks, although I am interested in learning about <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> in the future.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'JavaScript';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 60%;"> 60% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">JavaScript is a very versatile language mainly used for backend and frontend development for websites, but can also be used for many other purposes. I use JavaScript in almost every web application that I make and I have a lot of knowledge of how it works. However, I am unable to create many advanced applications and I do not have any knowledge in any other frameworks or libraries. I am very experienced with making AJAX applications using the latest JavaScript APIs and I know how to take advantage of new JS API features, such as notifications, PWA's, and ServiceWorkers! I have a lot of experience with Node.js and can manage small to medium sized projects & dependencies with npm.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'Java';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 10%;"> 10% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">I used to know Java very well, however I have since stopped using it (for now) to build applications. I completed multiple coding bootcamps that taught me the basics of Java, however I never fully utilized it and moved on. I started to really get into Java in 2018 but stopped using it in late 2020. As of now, I don't have much interest in learning more about it except for creating Minecraft servers. I only learned about the core Java functions and never got familiar with any libraries.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'Linux';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 40%;"> 40% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">I have a lot of knowledge of how to manage Linux computers. I know many Linux commands and I am very comfortable with the terminal. I know how to use some more advanced programs, like systemctl or supervisorctl, and my editor of choice is nano. I also have a Raspberry Pi that I customized heavily and I am now using Raspbian Lite paired with XFCE with a completely custom desktop theme, which makes it super lightweight and fast. I also had 1 year (2021) of experience managing Minecraft servers that were running on Linux and got used to how servers worked during that time. </span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'DaVinci Resolve';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 30%;"> 30% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">DaVinci Resolve is a free video editor for creating advanced videos. I know how to use it very well and have created many videos with it. I have a lot of experience and knowledge of how to use it's basic features, plus some of the more advanced effects and transitions. I don't have any knowledge of it's music editor or any of its paid features.</span> </div>

<div class="full tooltip" style="--language: 'SQL';"> <div class="progress">
<div class="progressinner" style="width: 40%;"> 40% </div></div>
<span class="tooltiptext">SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a super simple programming language to manage databases. The syntax of SQL is almost like English! Because of this and my knowledge of databases, I can say that I'm fairly knowledgeable when it comes to SQL and MySQL databases. I have also been looking into MySQL alternatives, however I currently only know how to use MySQL.</span> </div>
