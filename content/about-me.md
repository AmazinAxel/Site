# Hey!

I'm AmazinAxel, and I create stuff on the internet! I'm a full-stack web developer and I play video games and contribute to various projects. I'm based in the PNW, near Seattle, WA. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

I focus on developing websites and creating things for the web. Of course, I am very proficient in JavaScript, HTML & advanced CSS, but I'm also very experienced with Node.js and PHP.
